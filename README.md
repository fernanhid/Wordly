# international_news_topic_variation

My project aims to expand our world perspective by seeing the variation of news coverage between international newspapers. <br>
The newspapers include:<br>

a. New York Times (U.S.)<br>
b. La Republica (Peru)<br>
c. The Guardian (U.K.)<br>
d. Times of India (India)<br>
e. China Today (China)<br>
f. The Age (Australia)<br>

This is how the notebooks are organized by:

1. Data Acquisition (scrapping & API's), Cleaning, Storing (MongoDB, Pickle)
2.(a-f) Topic Modeling(NMF)/ Exploration
3. Country by country visualizatios of topics over time

Some of the Interesting Insights:
1. India focused on Brexit before anyone else
2. Peru and the U.S. focused on the arrival of Pope Francis
3. The U.K. covered Zika the most even though it's in the least danger
